## CLI Commands:

`Ctrl + C`  = Terminate a command that is running
`Ctrl + L`  = Clear text in the terminal
`Ctrl + A`  = Move the cursor to the beginning of a command
`Ctrl + E`  = Move the cursor to the end of a command
`Tab`       = Provide auto complete suggestions

`echo`      = prints out a message. E.g. `echo "I'm a hacker lol"`

`expr`      = prints out an expression. E.g. `expr 10 - 8` = 2
WARNING:    When using `expr` all terms and operators in an expression,
            are seperated by spaces.
`pwd`       = print working directory. Tells you what folder you are in
            This will print out the `absolute path`.

## What's the difference between the `absolute path` and the `relative path`?
The root is the first directory (folder) on your file system.
It is represented by `/` 

An absolute path starts from the root, 
and a relative path starts from the current directory.

`ls`        = List the files and folders in the current directory
            Hidden files and folders will NOT be shown
            Note: There is a more modern command known as `lsd`

`ls -a`     = List all files and folder in the current directory.
            Including hidden files and folders.

`tree`      = List the files and folders in the current directory,
            in a tree format.
            Note: There is a more modern tool calle `tre-command`
            
`cd`        = Change directory. E.g. `cd github/repos/`

`cd ..`     = Go up one level in the file structure. 
            E.g. If you were in the directory `cd github/repos/cool-project`,
            then typing `cd ..` will take you back to,
            the `github/repos/` folder

`cd ~`      = This will take you back to the home directory.

`cat`       = Displays the contents of a file. E.g `cat my_notes.md`
            Note: There is a more modern command known as `bat`,
            this has to be installed before you can use it.

`head`      = Displays the beginning of a file. By default 10 lines.
            To change the number of lines returned: `head -n 5`
            E.g. `head my_notes.md`

`tail`      = Displays the last 10 lines of a file.

`less`      = Return the contents of a file, one page at a time.
            E.g. `less my_noted.md`

`grep`      = Searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file,
            containing a specified
            The syntax is `grep what-you-want-to-find file_name.extension`
            E.g. `grep pizza meals_eaten.md`.
 
Another example: 
            `ls /home/analysts/reports | grep rust`
            This will return all files and directories,
            that contain the word rust.

## Understanding Piping `|`
`|` Sends the standard output of one command as standard input,
to another command for further processing.


`mkdir`     = Make a directory. Eg. `mdkir name-of-folder`
`rmkdir`    = Removes a directory. Eg. `rmdir name-of-folder`
`touch`     = Creates a file.
`rm`        = Removes, or deletes, a file
`mv`        = Move a file E.g. `mv current-file-path new-file-path`
`cp`        = Copy a path 

## Getting help about a command
`man`       = View the mannual of a command. E.g. `man name-of-command`
`whatis`    = Get a quick summary of what a command does. E.g. `whatis cat`
`apropos`   = Searches the mannual page descriptions for a specified string.
            E.g. `apropos password`. Show all lines with the word password.
            E.g. `appropos password -a change password`
            This will show all lines with both the words change and password.


## Using the `less` command
Once youâ€™ve accessed your content with the less command,
you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:

    Space bar: Move forward one page

    b: Move back one page

    Down arrow: Move forward one line

    Up arrow: Move back one line

    q: Quit and return to the previous terminal window
